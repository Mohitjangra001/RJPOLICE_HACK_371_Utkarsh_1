# Police Feedback System

## Problem Statement

Getting feedback on police operations is a challenging task due to outdated methods and privacy concerns. Traditional approaches, such as inspections and calls to complainants, are limited and lack inclusivity. This hampers the understanding of community sentiments and impedes effective addressing of policing issues.
